# CSS-Grid

## Objectives

Create a unique web layout using CSS Grid that showcases your understanding of how to combine Flexbox and Grid to organize and position content. You will also create and style some unique content to populate the different areas of the page.

## Instructions

### 1. Get set up

1. Clone your remote exercise repository onto your local machine.
2. Create a new a CSS file and link it to the index.html file.

**Tip: Read all the instructions and then sketch the layout and content of your page before you start to code. This will help you visualize how you want the content to be arranged and will ensure that your layout meets all the requirements in the instructions.**

### 2. Create the grid structure

In your styles.css, set the display property of the body element to grid.
Define the grid layout using:

- grid-template-columns to create a column structure.
- grid-template-rows to create a row structure.
- the repeat() function if/where appropriate to simplify your column definitions.
- grid-template-areas to visually organize the layout and assign areas for each element.

### 4. Add some HTML content to each cell

1. Header: Add a logo image and create a navigation bar with links to different sections of your site (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
2. Main: Include at least two section elements with content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and at least one relevant image. Each section will have a unique layout. Main should serve as the primary content area of your page.
3. Aside: This could include related articles, advertisements, or additional resources that might interest the reader. Include content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and at least one relevant image, and article elements is appropriate.
4. Footer: Provide contact information (such as an email address or phone number), links to social media profiles, and additional navigation links. Make sure to format the footer content neatly for easy access.

### 4. Style the layout

1. Apply a grid gap to create space between grid items, use background colors to differentiate sections, and add padding and margins to create a visually appealing layout.
2. Ensure that the layout is flexible by using relative units like fr, %, and rem for grid items and their content. This helps the layout adapt to different screen sizes.
3. Inside at least 2 grid cell, implement Flexbox for additional layout control, such as centering content or evenly spacing items within those sections.

### 4. Format, organize and add comments

- Use the Prettier VSCode extension to format HTML and CSS code.
- Add organizational CSS comments and order your style rules so that your CSS is easy to read.
- Add a few comments to explain your HTML and CSS code and highlight anything of interest.

### 5. Check for errors

- Use the VSCode HTMLHint extension and validate your HTML code to make sure that it is correct: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload. Take a screenshot of the results.
- Validate your CSS code to make sure that it is correct: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ for CSS. Take a screenshot of the results.
